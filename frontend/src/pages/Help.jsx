            <p>
              To create a carpool, click the "+ add" button on the dashboard. You'll be asked to provide details like your destination, departure time, and how many seats you have available. Adding a detailed description and tags will help others find your ride.

            <h3>How do I join an existing carpool?</h3>
            <p>
              From the dashboard, you can browse all available carpools. Click on any carpool to see more details. If it's a good fit, click the "Request to Join" button. The driver will be notified and can approve your request.

            <h3>What should I do if I need to cancel?</h3>
            <p>
              If your plans change, please act quickly. If you're a driver, you can delete your carpool from its detail page. If you're a passenger, you can cancel your request from the "My Trips" section. In either case, it's a good idea to communicate with the other members of the carpool as a courtesy.
